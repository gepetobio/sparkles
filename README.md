JS + Canvas: sparkles generator based on seb.ly's video (http://vimeo.com/36278748)

If you haven't seen the video CreativeJS for Designers (http://vimeo.com/36278748), please watch it! If you used to work with Flash and you kind of liked to do some animations only with actionscript, then you may get inspired!

So, using some javascript and html5 canvas, I created a sparkles generator, similar to the video. 

You can check the [DEMO](http://codepen.io/gepetobio/pen/okrnv) to have an idea of what it does.

Fork if you want, play with it, but I don't intend to keep working on this project. I just wanted to publish it to remind me how simple codes can be fun and amaze us once in a while :P

If you want to check new tests I'm doing based on this one, then go to https://github.com/gepetobio/sparkles-advanced
